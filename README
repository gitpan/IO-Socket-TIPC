IO::Socket::TIPC
=====================================

This is a TIPC (Transparent Inter-Process Communication) module for perl.  See
http://tipc.sf.net/ if you don't know what this is.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

* An operating system supported by TIPC, which also has Perl.  (So far, that
means Linux and Solaris.)  See the "OPERATING SYSTEM SUPPORT" section, below,
for more details.

* At build-time, it must be able to find the header file "tipc.h".  It will try
several well-known locations for Linux and Solaris, before giving up.  The vast
majority of the time, this works just fine.

* At runtime, it expects your kernel to have TIPC enabled.  (On Linux you'll
see a line in your /proc/net/protocols that starts with "TIPC"; on Solaris
you'll see the "tipc" module loaded in modinfo.)  Without this, many of the
most important tests will be skipped, and none of the examples will work, nor
will any real applications.  If you've built TIPC as a module, be sure you've
inserted that module into your kernel.

* The Scalar::Util perl module is required.

* In addition to the above, the test suite uses Test::Exception, Test::Pod and
Devel::Leak.  Without each of these, it will skip a portion of the tests.
Note: the Devel::Leak tests result in a lot of ugly hexspam, so it probably
isn't worth the trouble.  The other two modules are very helpful, though.


OPERATING SYSTEM SUPPORT

Linux has TIPC support built-in, as of kernel 2.6.16.  I believe there are
(older, possibly buggy) packages to support earlier versions of Linux, at
http://tipc.sf.net/ .

Solaris users get TIPC support through the use of a separate add-on package,
available at http://opensolaris.org/os/project/tipc/ .

I'm looking forward to supporting other operating systems, as soon as TIPC
itself does.  Patches are always welcome.
