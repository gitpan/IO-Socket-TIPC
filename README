IO-Socket-TIPC version 0.01
=====================================

This is a TIPC (Transparent Inter-Process Communication) module for perl.  See
http://tipc.sf.net/ if you don't know what this is.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

The Scalar::Util, Switch, and Test::Exception perl modules are required.
This runs under a linux kernel which has TIPC enabled.  If you built TIPC as
a module, be sure you've loaded it with the "modprobe" command.

I'm unaware of TIPC being supported for any platform other than Linux at
present, patches are welcome.

For building, it must be able to find the header file <linux/tipc.h>.  It will
try /usr/include and a couple of well-known kernel locations before giving up.
