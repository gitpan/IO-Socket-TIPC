IO-Socket-TIPC version 0.01
=====================================

This is a TIPC (Transparent Inter-Process Communication) module for perl.  See
http://tipc.sf.net/ if you don't know what this is.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

An operating system supported by TIPC, which also has Perl.  (So far, that
means Linux.)

At build-time, it must be able to find the header file "tipc.h".  It will try
/usr/include/linux and a couple of well-known Linux kernel locations before
giving up.

At runtime, it expects your kernel to have TIPC enabled.  (You'll see a line
in your /proc/net/protocols that starts with "TIPC".)  Without this, some of
the most important tests will be skipped, and none of the examples will work.
If you've built TIPC as a module, be sure you've loaded it with the "modprobe"
command.

The Scalar::Util and Switch perl modules are required.

In addition to the above, the test suite uses Test::Exception, Test::Pod and
Devel::Leak.  Without each of these, it will skip a portion of the tests.
Note: the Devel::Leak tests result in a lot of ugly hexspam, so it probably
isn't worth the trouble.  The other two modules are very helpful, though.

I'm looking forward to supporting other operating systems, as soon as TIPC
itself does.  Patches are always welcome.
