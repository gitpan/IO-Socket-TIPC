Revision history for Perl extension IO::Socket::TIPC.

0.01  Thu Apr 20 09:34:45 PDT 2006
	- First release.  Supports SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM.

0.02  Thu Apr 20 13:15:23 PDT 2006
	- minor POD fix.
	- tell CPANPLUS (and everyone else) that we only support Linux (for now).

0.03  Fri Apr 21 06:17:00 PDT 2006
	- Tested the module with 5.6.2 successfully.  Lower required version in
	  Makefile.PL, accordingly.  perl-5.6.0 failed to build (some Makefile
	  problem), so I was unable to test TIPC against that version.
	- Rework the Makefile.PL stuff that attempts to find tipc.h.  Work with a
	  tipc.h file from either linux kernel sources, or from the tipc addon
	  sources.
	- As a useful side effect of the above, tell CPANPLUS not to report build
	  failures if the prerequisites aren't met (OS = Linux, can find tipc.h).
	- Implement sendto() and recvfrom().  These are still a bit hackish at the
	  moment, but I can fix that without changing the API.
	- Write tests for SOCK_RDM and SOCK_DGRAM.  Update the testsuite to always
	  call things in the right order, rather than relying on sleep(1) to avoid
	  race conditions.  This speeds "make test" up by 5 seconds or more.
	- Adjust t/sockaddr.t to skip the throws_ok() tests, when the user doesn't
	  have Test::Exception installed.  Since we run without it, remove it from
	  the list of dependencies.
	- Release 0.03.
