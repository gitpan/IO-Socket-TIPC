Revision history for Perl extension IO::Socket::TIPC.

0.01  Thu Apr 20 09:34:45 PDT 2006
	- First release.  Supports SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM.

0.02  Thu Apr 20 13:15:23 PDT 2006
	- minor POD fix.
	- tell CPANPLUS (and everyone else) that we only support Linux (for now).

	- Tested the module with 5.6.2 successfully.  Lower required version in
	  Makefile.PL, accordingly.  perl-5.6.0 failed to build (some Makefile
	  problem), so I was unable to test TIPC against that version.
	- Rework the Makefile.PL stuff that attempts to find tipc.h.  Work with a
	  tipc.h file from either linux kernel sources, or from the tipc addon
	  sources.
	- As a useful side effect of the above, tell CPANPLUS not to report build
	  failures if the prerequisites aren't met (OS = Linux, can find tipc.h).
	- Implement sendto() and recvfrom().  These are still a bit hackish at the
	  moment, but I can fix that without changing the API.
	- Write tests for SOCK_RDM and SOCK_DGRAM.  Update the testsuite to always
	  call things in the right order, rather than relying on sleep(1) to avoid
	  race conditions.  This speeds "make test" up by 5 seconds or more.
	- Adjust t/sockaddr.t to skip the throws_ok() tests, when the user doesn't
	  have Test::Exception installed.  Since we run without it, remove it from
	  the list of dependencies.
	- Release 0.03.

	- Allan Stephens reported a couple of missing constants.  I went and
	  grabbed a copy of tipc-1.5.10, its TIPC is missing PF_TIPC, TIPC_CFG_SRV,
	  TIPC_TOP_SRV and TIPC_RESERVED_NODES.
	  In the interests of maximum portability, I'm making missing constants a
	  nonfatal error; the constant just returns 'undef' if it wasn't defined in
	  tipc.h.  Also, PF_TIPC is rather important, so I've conditionally defined
	  it to AF_TIPC in TIPC.xs when found to be undefined.  (linux-2.6.16's
	  tipc.h defines it the same way.)
	- Added an extra set of tests, to ensure useful return values from those
	  constants the TIPC module uses internally.  (Currently, a very small
	  subset of the full list.)
	- The socket(2) manpage indicates its first field should be a PF_* value,
	  not AF_*.  Switch TIPC.pm to use PF_TIPC.
	- Fix Sockaddr's _stringify() XS method, to print everything as unsigned
	  integers.  This is rather important; portid references are 32-bit and
	  they seem to be randomly generated, so the high bit is set half of the
	  time.
