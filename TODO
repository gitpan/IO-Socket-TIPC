* Exhaustive documentation of ->new() parameters, for TIPC.pm and Sockaddr.pm
* More examples.
* Check the XS exhaustively for memory leaks.
* Support the setsockopt bits mentioned in Programmers_Guide.txt.  Support any
  other common ones, too.  (See if IO::Socket::INET has any.)  Same with fcntl
  bits (Blocking?).  Add them to @EXPORT_OK, if they aren't already there.
* There's no good reason for Sockaddr to be a hashref, or to have a ->raw()
  method, at all.  Once Sockaddr.pm has per-field accessor methods for proper
  management, we can just pass around a blessed (scalar) binary blob directly.
  That'll remove all the current confusion about whether to use send() or
  sendto().
* For convenience, we're @EXPORT_OKing the SOCK_STREAM/SOCK_DGRAM/etc defines.
  We should do the same with the MSG_* bits for send/recv's flags param, too.
