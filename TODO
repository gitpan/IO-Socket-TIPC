* Exhaustive documentation of ->new() parameters, for TIPC.pm and Sockaddr.pm
* More examples.
* XS wrappers for tipc_zone, tipc_cluster, tipc_node, and tipc_addr.
* set_domain() needs to handle being passed a "<1.2.3>" string.
* Support the setsockopt bits mentioned in Programmers_Guide.txt.  Support any
  other common ones, too.  (See if IO::Socket::INET has any.)  Same with fcntl
  bits (Blocking?).  Add them to @EXPORT_OK, if they aren't already there.
* For convenience, we're @EXPORT_OKing the SOCK_STREAM/SOCK_DGRAM/etc defines.
  We should do the same with the MSG_* bits for send/recv's flags param, too.
