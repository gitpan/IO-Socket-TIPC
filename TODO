* More examples.
* Support the setsockopt bits mentioned in Programmers_Guide.txt.  Support any
  other common ones, too.  (See if IO::Socket::INET has any.)  Same with fcntl
  bits (Blocking?).  Add them to @EXPORT_OK, if they aren't already there.
* For convenience, we're @EXPORT_OKing the SOCK_STREAM/SOCK_DGRAM/etc defines.
  We should do the same with the MSG_* bits for send/recv's flags param, too.
* TIPC->new() should allow being passed Sockaddr objects for the Peer/Local
  parameters.
