This is a simple toolkit to send simple (one-line text) messages to any
interested parties on the network.

notify.pl sends a message to all receivers on the network, which you pass in
quotes as a command line argument.

monitor.pl prints all the messages it receives, and never exits.

waitfor.pl waits for a specific message, prints it and exits.  You specify the
message on its command line; it will match any message which starts with the
specified string.

The obvious use for this is event notification.  For instance, one host has
finished creating a file of some sort, (media, software binary release), and
tells the web server to copy the file out of a tmp-directory into a web server
directory, over nfs.

This is also a useful base model to extend for various purposes, such as
gaming and text messaging.

This protocol runs connectionless, using the name {1935081472, 1}.
